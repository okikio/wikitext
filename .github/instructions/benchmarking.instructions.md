# Benchmarking Rules

This repo uses `mitata`.

## Non-negotiable

Always wrap benchmark results with `do_not_optimize()`.

```ts
import { bench, do_not_optimize } from 'npm:mitata';

bench('parse: simple article', () => {
  do_not_optimize(parse(simpleArticle));
});
```

A benchmark that does not consume its result is not trustworthy.

## Prevent constant folding and loop hoisting

Use computed parameters or generated inputs when a constant input could be hoisted or folded by the engine.

Do not benchmark the same precomputable literal in every iteration when that would let the engine optimize away meaningful work.

## GC control

Use `.gc('inner')` for allocation-heavy benchmarks.

```ts
bench('parse: large article', () => {
  do_not_optimize(parse(largeArticle));
}).gc('inner');
```

Use `.gc('outer')` when you want lower overhead and can tolerate less stable per-iteration numbers.

## Scaling benchmarks

Prefer `.range()` for scaling tests instead of manually enumerating many `.args(...)` values.

## Compare against competitors

Do not make performance claims without baseline comparisons.

Benchmark against relevant alternatives on the same inputs.

Keep competitor and local benchmarks in the same group when possible.

## Benchmark realistic scenarios

Do not rely only on tiny microbenchmarks.

Include representative scenarios such as:

* token-only
* events-only
* full AST
* round-trip
* outline-only
* large real-world article
* pathological input

## Memory and allocation tests

Do not mix ad-hoc heap measurement inside the hot benchmark callback.

Either:

* convert the scenario into a proper mitata benchmark with controlled GC
* or move memory checks into a separate regression-focused test or benchmark file

## Anti-patterns

* forgetting `do_not_optimize()`
* benchmarking only happy paths
* benchmarking only tiny synthetic inputs
* using different inputs across libraries while claiming a comparison
* making performance claims without a baseline
* mixing manual heap checks into benchmark callbacks

## Live editing and streaming benchmarks

When incremental or session APIs exist, include benchmarks for:

* keystroke edits
* append-only streaming
* burst edit merges

Measure the full user-relevant operation, not just the cheapest internal sub-step.
